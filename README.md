### This is Jo Creyf's personal GitHub account!

You're not going to find that much here because I do most of my work in my company's GitHub repositories and I also host a private Git server on my home NAS server.<br>

I'm working a lot on HashiCorp Terraform and Puppet projects these days to deploy and manage AWS cloud platforms.<br>
So I get to spend A LOT of time all over AWS in a DevOps role to design, create and support cloud solutions.<br>
"Infrastructure as Code" (IaC) is, and has been, my main work focus for the last 4 years.<br>

I'm doing a lot of automation.  It's my purpose in life!  If I have to do a task multiple times, then I always look into simplifying it and automating as much as I can.<br>
There's a lot of shell scripting, Python coding going on, on top of the common IaC toolset (Terraform; Puppet; Rundeck; GitHub; Jenkins; ...).<br>

This is all coming after many years of full stack software development in mostly Java and SQL.<br>
